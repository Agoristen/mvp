# example-project

This project is based on the default template for Vue 3 + Vite development. 

I'm using yalc to link local dependencies. If you haven't yet, go to `example-library` and run `yalc publish`.

Afterwards, go back here in `example-project` and run
```sh
yalc add example-library
```

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
