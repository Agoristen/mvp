# example-library

This is an example library (based on jstree). 

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```
I'm using yalc to link local dependencies. So you'll need to publish the library.
```sh
yalc publish
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

After building, make sure to push changes to yalc:
```sh
yalc push
```
